Helps someone counting money to know how much to give mack in the fewest dollars and cents
could be a way to teach someone how to count money or for someone who works in a money counting job


Just input the amount you need to give back and it will show you how much in dollars and cents
click the minus sign if you have run out of that bill or cents and will recalculate to next bill
